# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project aims to
adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `sdpa_vector` attention sinks and boolean masks, with a wide-MQA dispatch
  shape for single-KV-head decode (one query head block per simdgroup).
- **Segmented MoE quantized GEMM** (`kq.gather_qmm_segments`): bulk routed
  prefill over a descriptor of contiguous expert row ranges, float32 I/O and
  accumulate on the GGUF wire bytes.
- **Sorted-ids MoE quantized GEMM** (`kq.gather_qmm_sorted`): the segmented
  GEMM with the per-expert row ranges derived in-kernel from sorted expert
  ids, removing the host-side descriptor pass.
- Device-A fragment tiles for the segments/sorted GEMM family
  (`KQ_SEG_TILE`, default `t48x128x16a`): simdgroup-matrix staging of the
  dequantized A fragment; `fh`/`ah` half-staging variants remain opt-in.
- **Fused SwiGLU routed GEMM** (`kq.gather_qmm_sorted_swiglu`): combined
  gate/up expert stacks activate in the epilogue, halving the bulk routed
  dispatch count for GLU experts.
- Register-direct dequant body for the segments/sorted GEMM family as a
  parked opt-in (`KQ_SEG_TILE=...dr`); measured slower than threadgroup
  staging on M3, kept for newer-architecture probes.
- **Decode-shaped routed-MoE matvec pair** (`kq.gather_qmv_pair_swiglu`,
  `kq.gather_qmv_expert_sum`): one dispatch computes every routed expert's
  fused gate/up + SwiGLU activation row for a single token with the route
  weight baked into the stored intermediate (combined gate/up stack,
  iq2_xxs), and one dispatch computes the down matvec with the sum over the
  token's routed experts inside the kernel (q2_k), removing the separate
  route-weighted-sum reduction. Float32 accumulate; numerically equivalent
  but not bit-identical to the unfused gather_qmm composition. Instantiated
  for the served DS4 decode codec pair only; other codecs fail closed at the
  op level.

### Changed
- SwiGLU epilogues pin `metal::precise::exp`; the softmax fast::exp sites
  carry an annotation for why the fast form stays.


## [0.3.1]

### Added
- `sdpa_fa_verify`: simdgroup-matrix speculative-verify attention for a
  GQA-folded query tile (G*q_len <= 32 rows, q_len 2..8, head_dim 256).
  Streams each contiguous KV split once through threadgroup-staged K/V tiles
  with S = Q@K^T and O += P@V on the matrix units, float32 accumulators, and a
  per-row offset-causal online softmax; reuses the `sdpa_decode_gqa`
  split-merge pass.
- `verify_zero_copy_views(items, no_alias=[])` and `zero_copy_view_count()`:
  post-load integrity check that arrays backed by a GGUF mapping still carry
  their wire dtype (integer reinterprets allowed) and that `no_alias` names
  own their buffers. Catches buffer donation into the file mapping: a donated
  dtype-changing copy leaves an array typed X over wire bytes typed Y, and
  the write is dropped on read-only maps. Metadata-only, O(#tensors).

### Changed
- `load_gguf` zero-copy mappings are now read-only shared (`PROT_READ` +
  `MAP_SHARED`) instead of writable private. Private mappings made the GPU
  write-fault every wired page, lazily copying the whole file into anonymous
  memory that can only be compressed, never dropped (a hidden full-model RAM
  copy on top of the page cache carrying the same bytes); read-only shared
  pages are wired in place and stay clean, evictable file cache.
  `KQ_GGUF_MMAP=private_rw` restores the old mode; `private_ro` is a
  diagnostic quadrant.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- Fused MoE gather kernels: for quantized experts: `moe_glu_gather_kq` /
  `gather_qmv_kq` cover all 19 GGUF codecs (K-quant, legacy, IQ) plus
  mixed-codec shared experts; `moe_glu_gather` / `gather_qmv_bias` cover mxfp4.
  Each fuses the expert gather, dequant mat-vec, and GLU activation into one
  dispatch. Wide K-lane (NX=16/32) variants engage automatically for
  decode-scale two-stream GLU gathers.
- Fused MoE router: (`moe_router_topk`): softmax + top-k + weight norm +
  shared-gate sigmoid in one dispatch; no-shexp routing-mix gather and
  per-expert-scale support; q8_0 odd-K fallback.
- `sdpa_decode_gqa`: tile-staged GQA decode SDPA kernel (head_dim
  64/128/256/512, GQA factor 2..16, attention sinks folded into the merge
  pass), with pair variants accepting verify widths (q_len 2..4, subject to
  gqa_factor * q_len <= 32).
- Fused residual/rmsnorm glue ops (`add_rmsnorm`, `rmsnorm_multi3`,
  `rmsnorm2_add`) with register-cached 4-wide reads, row-sized threadgroups,
  and scalar CPU eval paths.

### Changed
- `KQuantEmbedding` output dtype defaults to bf16 (was f16).
- q8_0 decode `qmv`/`qmv_fast` fuse the bias add.

## [0.2.1]

### Added
- **Verify mat-vec kernels (`mul_mv_ext` port)** for speculative-decode verify
  and batched MTP. Flat-with-M kernels ported from ggml's `mul_mv_ext` for all
  K-quant, legacy, and IQ codecs via a shared `kq_mv_ext_impl` template. Gated
  at M>=3 for non-IQ codecs (verify_qmv wins at M<=2) and all-M for IQ. Extends
  to M=12 for batch MTP verify.
- **Compiled vector SDPA kernel (`kq.sdpa_vector`)** for head_dim 256 and 512
  with GQA and strided KV support.
- **Synthetic all-codec matmul test** (`test_matmul_synth.py`) - GGUF-free
  quantized-matmul validation across all codecs.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- IQ codecs are now full-featured alongside the K-quant/legacy codecs. All nine
  (`iq4_nl, iq4_xs, iq3_s, iq3_xxs, iq2_xxs, iq2_xs, iq2_s, iq1_s, iq1_m`) gained:
  - **NAX (tensor-core) matmul** for prefill, matching the K-quant kernels
    (decode `qmv` unchanged).
  - **`quantize` (encode)** — a scalar CPU port of ggml's `quantize_row_iq*`
    quantizers (grid search + inverse-index neighbour tables), so `kq.quantize`,
    the `convert` driver, and the `mlx-kquant quantize` CLI now produce every IQ
    codec. IQ encode is CPU-only (ggml has no GPU IQ quantizer) and is routed to
    a CPU stream internally. `iq2_xxs`, `iq2_xs`, and `iq1_s` require an
    importance matrix (mirroring ggml) and reject a missing one.

## [0.1.2]

### Fixed
- `mlx-kquant lora`/`chat` require `--model` and no longer fall back to an mlx-lm
  default model, potentially fetched from hf hub.
- expanded cli help

## [0.1.1]

Docs: PyPI install instructions, no code changes

## [0.1.0]

First public release. A C++/Metal extension for a stock `mlx==0.31.2` wheel that
adds the K-quant superblock and per-block integer codecs as native MLX ops
(`kq.dequantize` / `quantized_matmul` / `gather_qmm` / `quantize`), with Metal and
portable CPU paths for all ten codecs. On top of the ops, the `mlx-kquant` CLI
quantizes an HF / mlx-lm model into a K-quant MLX safetensors checkpoint and runs,
chats with, LoRA-fine-tunes, and fuses it, with importance-matrix calibration and
per-tensor recipe inspection. A loader runs those checkpoints on stock mlx-lm.

### Notes
- `requires-python >= 3.10` (mlx 0.31.2 ships no cp39 wheel).
- The GPU path is macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later on Apple Silicon (Metal); the NAX
  matmul kernel needs the Metal 4 SDK (`MetalPerformancePrimitives`). Linux is
  supported CPU-only - build against `mlx[cpu]==0.31.2`; model forwards there also
  need `MLX_DISABLE_COMPILE=1` (an upstream MLX CPU-JIT limitation under GCC, not
  mlx-kquant).
